        <b>prefers-color-scheme:</b>In cultures where white is associated with
        mourning (e.g., some Asian countries), dark mode might be perceived as
        more neutral or respectful. Can also reflect environmental or religious
        needs (e.g., avoiding light during nighttime prayers like during
        Ramadan).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>prefers-reduced-motion:</b> In some cultures, visual sobriety is valued
        and seen as more professional. Providing a calmer experience when requested
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>forced-color:</b> Using forced-colors mode honors users who deliberately
        reject default color schemes—whether for health reasons (e.g. light sensitivity),
        aesthetic preferences, or cultural interpretations of color. Some users from
        low-vision communities, older generations, or specific cultural backgrounds
        always use system themes like “High Contrast Black” or “High Contrast White.”
        A culturally inclusive UI embraces these modes as valid and valuable—not
        as edge cases
